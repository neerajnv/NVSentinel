## Decision-Making Process

### Code Changes

1. **Pull Request Process**:
   - All pull requests require at least one review from a Reviewer
   - All pull requests require approval from at least one Approver
   - Maintainers can approve their own changes, but should seek review from another Maintainer for significant changes
   - All CI checks must pass before merging

2. **Review Requirements**:
   - Small changes (documentation, typo fixes): 1 Reviewer approval
   - Standard changes: 1 Reviewer + 1 Approver approval
   - Significant changes (new features, major refactoring): 2 Reviewers + 1 Approver approval
   - Architectural changes: 2 Approvers + 1 Maintainer approval

### Design and Architecture Decisions

1. **Proposal Process**:
   - Create a GitHub Discussion or issue with the `design` label
   - Tag relevant Maintainers and Approvers
   - Allow at least 1 week for community feedback
   - Document the decision and rationale

2. **Decision Authority**:
   - Minor design decisions: Any Approver
   - Significant design decisions: Majority of Maintainers
   - Major architectural changes: Supermajority (2/3) of Maintainers or Technical Leads

### Conflict Resolution

1. **Technical Disagreements**:
   - Discuss in pull request comments or GitHub Discussions
   - If unresolved, escalate to Maintainers
   - Maintainers will facilitate discussion and make a decision
   - Final appeal to Technical Leads if needed

2. **Code of Conduct Issues**:
   - Report to GitHub_Conduct@nvidia.com (as per [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md))
   - Maintainers will investigate and take appropriate action

## Areas of Ownership

The project is organized into several areas, each with their own Reviewers and Approvers:

- **Core Infrastructure**: Platform connectors, store client, data models
