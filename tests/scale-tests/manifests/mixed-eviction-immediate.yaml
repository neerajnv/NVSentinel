# Mixed Eviction Test - Immediate Mode Namespace
# Used for Mixed Eviction Tests (Issue #386)
#
# Pattern: 1500 pods (~1 per node) with Immediate eviction mode
# Resources: Small (10m CPU, 32Mi memory per pod)
# Termination: 30 seconds
# Eviction Mode: Immediate - pods are evicted immediately when node is drained
